# After The Move ♟️
**A high-performance, real-time chess platform featuring AI analysis and LLM coaching.**

`After The Move` is an elite-tier chess platform built for speed, scalability, and deep game analysis. It leverages a modern distributed architecture to handle real-time gameplay, spectator synchronization, and AI-driven insights.



## 🚀 Key Features
- **Low-Latency Gameplay:** Powered by Go Goroutines and WebSockets for near-instant movement synchronization.
- **Advanced Matchmaking:** Implementation of the **Glicko-2 rating system** for accurate skill assessment.
- **Stockfish Integration:** Real-time move evaluation using Stockfish (WASM on client-side for zero-cost analysis).
- **AI Coach:** Personalized post-game analysis using LLMs to explain tactical errors based on PGN data.
- **Spectator Support:** Pub/Sub architecture via Redis to support thousands of concurrent viewers.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

### Backend (The Core)
- **Language:** Go (Golang) - Chosen for its superior concurrency model and performance.
- **Communication:** Gin-Gonic (REST API) + Gorilla WebSocket (Real-time).
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (ACID compliant storage) + **Redis** (Real-time game state & caching).
- **Architecture:** Hexagonal / Clean Architecture to decouple business logic from external drivers.

### Frontend (The Interface)
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router) with TypeScript.
- **State Management:** Zustand (High-performance, minimal boilerplate).
- **Visuals:** Tailwind CSS + Radix UI + Lucide Icons.
- **Chess Logic:** Chess.js (Rules engine) + React-chessboard.
